	<!-- First person modlet for vehicles except the Gyro as may cause motion sickness.
		This is adjusting the camera views and turnrate and minor changes to vehicle physics to minimise glitching .. Headlight modlet optimised for 1st Person
		Please remove my other Headlight modlet if you are using this modlet.
		
		Note : If you use setting '0' then be prepared as when player is wearing a standard mining helmet or has afro hairstyle
		you may occasionally see the helmet light or hair style glitch through when riding bikes, normal helmets with lights added are are not as visible.
		
		*** Camera Distance Setting Overview ***
		-0.35,-0.55  Default changed values for bicycle
		-0,65,-0.55  Default changed values for minibike
		-1.55,-1.55  Default Changed value for Motorcycle, use if you want to revert back if you try the '0' Setting
		 -2.2, -2.2  Values for 4x4 if you want to revert back after trying the '0' Setting 
		 
		 Please note : If you are using the 7 days mod launcher it will
		 overide if you are using setting '0' 
		 
		 -1.7, -1,7 gives a closer 3rd person view on the motorcycle -->
